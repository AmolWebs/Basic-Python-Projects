This Python script allows users to search for information on various topics using Wikipedia. It provides a simple command-line interface to input a query and fetches a summary based on the input. It also offers an option to re-run the code or exit after obtaining the desired information. The script requires Python 3.6+ and standard libraries like `os`, `pyfiglet`, `termcolor`, `sys`, along with the `wikipedia` module for fetching Wikipedia data.
