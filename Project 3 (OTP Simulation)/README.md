# Project 3: OTP Verification

This project simulates a simple one-time password (OTP) verification process. The user enters their name and the program generates a random OTP and saves it to a file. The user then enters the OTP, and the program checks if the entered OTP matches the generated OTP. If the OTP matches, a success message is displayed; otherwise, an error message is shown. The user can choose to run the verification process again or exit.
