# Project 2: Site Opener

This project is a simple command-line utility that allows the user to open specific websites in their default web browser. The user can choose between three websites: YouTube, Google Meet, and Gmail. The program displays a banner, provides options, and opens the selected site in the background. After opening the site, the user can choose to run the program again or exit.
