# Project 5 (Number Guessing Game)

The "Guess the Number" game is a Python program where you try to guess a secret number between 1 and 100. The program gives you hints about your guesses and cheers you on when you guess right. It also keeps track of your best score and lets you know if you beat it. After playing, you can choose to play again or stop.
